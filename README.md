# Secret Unfolds

In this project, I created an animation that simulates the effect of square boxes unfolding, inspired by the example below. The animation showcases the boxes gradually unfolding with the use of **CSS transforms**, positioning, and timing effects.

### Languages Used
- **HTML** for structuring the webpage
- **CSS** for styling and creating the animation

### Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to create an animation using CSS where four square boxes gradually unfold. The core techniques I used include:
- **`transform`** for animating the position and size of the boxes.
- **`relative` and `absolute` positioning** to position the boxes within a container and allow them to unfold correctly.
- **CSS animations** to control the timing and transitions of the unfolding effect.

I started by creating four square boxes, each with a distinct background color: `steelblue`, `dimgray`, `rosybrown`, and `yellow`. Then I applied CSS to animate their unfolding behavior.

### Features
- Created four square boxes with the specified colors.
- Used **`transform`** and **positioning** techniques to make the boxes unfold.
- Applied a custom animation to make the unfolding effect smooth and visually appealing.
